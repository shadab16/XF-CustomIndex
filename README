Installation
#######################################

1. Upload the "GeekPoint" directory inside your /library/ directory.
2. Done! 


Usage/API
#######################################

There's only one static method which you need to call. The first argument
(type: Zend_Config) is the configuration data you need to pass; and the
second argument (type: array) is the data supplied by init_dependencies.

	GeekPoint_CustomIndex_Helper::setDefaultRoute($config, $data);


Configuration
#######################################

routePrefix
	This is the route prefix which you want to set as the default.
	Suppose you set the "foo" route-prefix as default, any links generated
	for "foo" or "foo/index" will now point to the homepage "/".

controllerClass
	This is the controller class which will handle the homepage.
	Specifically, the actionIndex() method in your controller will be
	responsible for generating the homepage.

majorSection
	[Optional] The major section-name, used when generating the route-match
	for homepage.

minorSection
	[Optional] The minor section-name, used when generating the route-match
	for homepage.

params
	[Optional] Parameters that will be added to the request object during
	the routing process. This enables you to set any content which depends
	upon a request parameter to be present, as your homepage. For example:
	node "Pages", or Threads (yes, threads! But for heaven's sake don't do that.)


Example
#######################################

Create a new event-listener for init_dependencies. Then in your callback method,
just set the configuration options, and call the helper. That's it.


	public static function listen(XenForo_Dependencies_Abstract $dependencies, array $data)
	{
	    if (!$dependencies instanceof XenForo_Dependencies_Public)
	    {
	        return;
	    }
	
	    $config = new Zend_Config(array(
	        'routePrefix'     => 'recent-activity',
	        'controllerClass' => 'XenForo_ControllerPublic_RecentActivity',
	    ));
	
	    GeekPoint_CustomIndex_Helper::setDefaultRoute($config, $data);
	}
